# NautilusSVN has moved! #

Greetings,

We are excited to announce the release of RabbitVCS v0.12, the successor to
NautilusSVN!

With our goal of extending support across multiple version control systems
and even to other file managers and programs, our first major release with the
new team seemed like the perfect time to make this change.

Please head over to http://rabbitvcs.org/ to read all about it, and of course to
try out our latest release.
