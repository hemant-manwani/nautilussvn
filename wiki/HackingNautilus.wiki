#summary This page shows you how to work on Nautilus

= Introduction =
Sometimes a feature will be missing from either from the Nautilus Python bindings (such as was the case with submenu support for quite a while) or Nautilus itself. In that case you'll have to hack Nautilus. This guide will explain how to get, build and develop for Nautilus.

== Requirements ==
sudo apt-get build-dep nautilus
sudo apt-get install gnome-common # Missing from the build-dep

== Building ==
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix="/usr"
mkdir -p /tmp/nautilus-testing
TMPDIR="/tmp/nautilus-testing/ ./src/nautilus --no-desktop
