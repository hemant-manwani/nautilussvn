#summary NautilusSvn has several configuration options
#labels Featured

There are several user-definable switches in the file [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/source/browse/trunk/helper.py helper.py] that change the behaviour of the extension.

*ENABLE_EMBLEMS* - This turns on/off the rendering of status emblems oneach file icon in the file browser.

*ENABLE_ATTRIBUTES* - Adds revision and author columns to the list view in Nautilus.

*DIFF_TOOL* - Specifes which executable to use for diff operations. I've tried it with gvidiff, but I mostly use Meld since it's ace.

*RECURSIVE_STATUS* - If enabled, the file status check when drawing emblems will use recursive checks. This is a bit experimental, as it might cause high CPU loads on large working copies.
	
*SWAP* - Set to True to swap the order of old and new versions of files in diff tool. Default is False, new version at left and old one at right.
