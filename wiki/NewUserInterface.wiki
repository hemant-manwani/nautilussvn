= Introduction =

I'm constructing a new user interface for NautilusSvn based on pyGTK and glade files.  My plan is to have a window or dialog for every piece of functionality that TortoiseSVN has.  I'm also attempting to create the UI elements in a standard way which will be documented here.

= Windows =
  * Add
  * Checkout
  * Commit
  * Branch
  * Log
  * Properties
  * Notification (shows callback messages from the vcs)
  * Import
  * Switch
  * Export
  * Cleanup
  * Update To Revision
  * Relocate
  * Merge Wizard (3 Steps)
    * Merge Type (Step 1) 
      # Merge a range of revisions (Step 2a)
      # Reintegrate a branch (Step 2b)
      # Merge two different trees (Step 2c)
    * Merge Options (Step 3)
  * Lock / Unlock
  * Rename
  * Resolve
  * Settings

= Dialogs =
  * Previous Messages
  * SSL Certificate
  * HTTP/HTTPS Authorization
  * Property


= Interface Standards =
I'd like to follow the [http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/ Gnome HIG] as much as possible. For examples of the look and feel of Gnome applications see GnomeLookandFeel. Here's an example of a preferences dialog from Nautilus:

[http://nautilussvn.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/GnomeLookandFeel/nautilus_preferences.png]

=== Windows ===
Each window will be sized differently, but each window should have a similar look and feel, with identical paddings and borders.  For example, each window has a vertical box as it's primary means of layout.  And each primary vertical box has a 12px border width and 18px spacing between items.

=== Buttons ===
Use stock buttons where possible.  Most windows/dialogs will have OK and Cancel buttons on the bottom right like so:

  Cancel | OK

If/When we implement Help buttons, they will go on the bottom left of the window.  For wizards like the merge wizard, we will have Forward, Back, and Cancel buttons for each step.  The Back button should be disabled on the first step, and the Forward button should be replaced by a Finish button on the last step.  They should appear on the bottom right like so:

  Cancel | Back | Forward

Regarding spacing, the bottom of each window should have a horizontal button box with 6px spacing between buttons and 0px border width.  Each button will have 0px border width and 0px spacing.  Layout style should be "End".

=== Groups ===
Groups of widgets with a similar purpose or functionality should generally be enclosed like so...

Vertical Box (6px spacing)
  Label Heading (bolded, aligned left)

  Alignment (12px left padding)
    Vertical Box (6px spacing)  or
    Horizontal Box (12px spacing)

= Settings Manager =
The next version of NautilusSvn is going to have a basic settings manager that has a few important features.  The breadth and number of options will be expanded in succeeding releases.  Here is a tentative list of tabs/options I'd like to implement.

  * General
    * NautilusSvn-specific Options (language)
    * Subversion-specific Options (subversion config file path, global ignore pattern)
  * External Programs
    * Compare Different Files (def: meld)
    * Merge Different Files (def: meld)
    * View .diff files (def: meld)
    * Repository Browser (def: firefox)
  * Saved Data (Consists of buttons to clear each listed option)
    * URL History
    * Log messages
    * Authentication data

In the future I'd like to add support for setting hook scripts, customizing the context menu and dialogs, and editing the icon set.  There are also various subtle options that can be added into each aforementioned tab, but many will have to wait.
