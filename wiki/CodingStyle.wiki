= Introduction =

If anything in this document differs from [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP 8] (Style Guide for Python Code) then please correct it as the PEP is leading.

= General =

== From PEP-8 ===

  * Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
  * Never mix tabs and spaces. Spaces only.
  * Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
  * Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings
  * Imports should usually be on separate lines
  * Imports should be grouped in the following order (you should put a blank line between each group of imports): 
    ** 1. standard library imports
    ** 2. related third party imports
    ** 3. local application/library specific imports

= Specific =

  * Double quotes should be used to indicate strings, i.e. "This is a string."
  * When referring to both files and directories use the term "items" not "files". Also sometimes you want to use "paths".

= Comments =

  * http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/
  * http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html
