In this page we'll look at what exactly a Nautilus extension is (the interface etc.) and dive into the NautilusSvn specifics.

== The basics of a Nautilus extension ==
NautilusSvn is a Nautilus extension written in Python using the [http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/nautilus-python/trunk/ Python bindings for the Nautilus extension library] (nautilus-python in short). For an extensive introduction see [http://taschenorakel.de/svn/repos/bulldozer/trunk/documentation/NautilusExtensions.html Nautilus Extensions].

A Nautilus extension can implement a couple of providers (interfaces), namely: 

  * NautilusInfoProvider: Information providers are used to add data to a NautilusFileInfo object and keep it up to date.
  * NautilusColumnProvider: Column providers add information to display in the list and icon views.
  * NautilusMenuProvider: Menu providers add menu items. Menu items can be added in three places: Per-file (shown in the file's context menu and the Edit menu), per-folder (shown in the background context menu and the File menu), and the toolbar.
  * NautilusPropertyPageProvider: Property providers add a property page to the file properties dialog.

Each of these providers come with their own set of functions one has to implement which in turn Nautilus will call to get 'things done'. We'll take a look specifically at NautilusInfoProvider.

== NautilusInfoProvider ==
When implementing the NautilusInfoProvider interface one has to implement the update_file_info function. 

  * TODO: write something about when update_file_info is exactly called and the relation with invalidate_extension_info on a GnomeVFSFileInfo.
