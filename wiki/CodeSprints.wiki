Why is update_file_items being called twice?

{{{

A: It's not, the logger is doing this. Why?

Why? Because it uses addHandler and everytime a Log instance is created addHandler is called which just adds to the handler that is already there.

The logger seems a little too complicated, can't we do something simpler? Yes, we want a file log and a console log, and yes the logging module is cool, but this is too much code.
