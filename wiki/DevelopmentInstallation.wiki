#summary Installation for hacking on NautilusSvn only

  _*<font color="red">WARNING: Only follow these instructions if you actually want to hack on NautilusSvn, otherwise stick to installing the development snapshot. If you are an end-user please do not follow these instructions.</font>*_

It's a good idea organize your code in the following way, this makes it easy to switch between branches and whatnot without fiddling too much. 

== Directory structure ==

{{{
mkdir -p ~/Development/nautilussvn/branches
ln -s ~/Development/nautilussvn/trunk ~/Development/nautilussvn/current
}}}

You'll notice later that this will make it easy to switch between branches, you simply have to change the directory current is pointing to (as long as the branch doesn't deviate too much).

== Checking out NautilusSvn ==

{{{
svn checkout http://nautilussvn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk ~/Development/nautilussvn/trunk
}}}

Let's link everything to the current directory:

{{{
mkdir -p ~/.nautilus/python-extensions
ln -s ~/Development/nautilussvn/current/nautilussvn/lib/extensions/nautilus/NautilusSvn.py ~/.nautilus/python-extensions/NautilusSvn.py
mkdir -p ~/.icons
ln -s ~/Development/nautilussvn/current/nautilussvn/data/icons/hicolor ~/.icons/ 
}}}

== Setting up a local PYTHONPATH ==

{{{
~/Development/python 
~/Development/python/nautilussvn symbolic link to ~/Development/nautilussvn/current
}}}

Change {{{~/.profile}}} to include the line:

{{{
export PYTHONPATH="/home/bruce/Development/python"
}}}

And parse this file in your {{{~/.bashrc}}} so this environment variable is also available to Bash (note that ~/.profile needs to executable):

{{{
# Source .profile
if [ -f ~/.profile ]; then
  . ~/.profile
fi
}}}

Placing it in {{{~/.profile}}} is needed because your GNOME session isn't started from a shell, so {{{~/.bashrc}}} etc. is not parsed. You'll have to restart your session (logout/login) for the changes to take effect. Or you can load the extension immediately using (it won't be available to any programs not started from the shell though):

{{{
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/home/$USER/Development/python/"
nautilus -q && nautilus &
}}}
