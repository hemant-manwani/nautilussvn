Installing globally is precisely the same as described in ManualInstallation, however if you want to install NautilusSvn locally and be able to update with a simple 'svn update' command you'll have to follow these instructions: 

{{{
svn checkout http://nautilussvn.googlecode.com/svn/tags/latest-snapshot ~/nautilussvn

mkdir -p ~/.nautilus/python-extensions
ln -s ~/nautilussvn/nautilussvn/lib/extensions/nautilus/NautilusSvn.py ~/.nautilus/python-extensions/NautilusSvn.py
mkdir -p ~/.icons
ln -s ~/nautilussvn/nautilussvn/data/icons/hicolor ~/.icons/ 
}}}

Add the following line to to /etc/environment (replace $USER with your username):

{{{
PYTHONPATH="/home/$USER/nautilussvn/"
}}} 

Note that /etc/environment is only parsed when X is started, but you can load the extension immediately using:
{{{
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/home/$USER/nautilussvn/"
nautilus -q && nautilus &
}}}
