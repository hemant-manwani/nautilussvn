  <font color="#00F">_*NOTE: installing from the latest-snapshot tag is currently [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/v012_Installation the recommended method] for installing !NautilusSvn.*_</font>

We're currently working on a new version of !NautilusSvn and intend to release easy to install packages (including a Debian package) in the very near future. Currently we're regularly creating snapshots of our development version which we consider stable enough for actual usage, the instructions for installing these snapshots can be found [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/v012_Installation here].

As !NautilusSvn is under active development it's advised to keep track of [http://groups.google.com/group/nautilussvn/ the mailing list] and/or the [http://cobradragon.com/nautilussvn/ blog].
