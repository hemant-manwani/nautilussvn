As !NautilusSvn is under active development it's advised to keep track of [http://groups.google.com/group/nautilussvn/ the mailing list] and/or the [http://cobradragon.com/nautilussvn/ blog].

== Packages ==

  <font color="#00F">_*NOTE: this page is under construction, packages are not yet available.*_</font>

We're currently working on a new version of !NautilusSvn and intend to release easy to install packages (including a Debian package) in the very near future. You will be able to find the packages in the [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/downloads/list downloads section].

Installing NautilusSvn is currently the easiest for users of Ubuntu (specifically Intrepid Ibex, or 8.10), however we've written up extensive installation instructions for users of other Linux distros.
