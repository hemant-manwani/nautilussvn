As !NautilusSvn is under active development it's advised to keep track of [http://groups.google.com/group/nautilussvn/ the mailing list] and/or the [http://cobradragon.com/nautilussvn/ blog].

== Packages ==

We're currently working on a new version of !NautilusSvn and intend to release easy to install packages (including a Debian package) in the very near future. You will be able to find the packages in the [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/downloads/list downloads section].

Installing NautilusSvn is currently the easiest for users of Ubuntu (specifically Intrepid Ibex, or 8.10), however we've written up extensive installation instructions for users of other Linux distros. You can find them [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/v012_Installation here].

== Development snapshots ==

Currently we're regularly creating snapshots of our development version which we consider stable enough for actual usage, the instructions for installing these snapshots can be found [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/v012_Installation here].
