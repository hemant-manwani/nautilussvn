We're currently working on a new version of NautilusSvn v0.12 and intend to release easy to install packages (including a Debian package) in the very near future. Currently we're regularly creating snapshots of our development version which we consider stable enough for actual usage, the instructions for installing these snapshots can be found [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/v012_Installation here].
