As !NautilusSvn is under active development it's advised to keep track of [http://groups.google.com/group/nautilussvn/ the mailing list] and/or the [http://cobradragon.com/nautilussvn/ blog].

== Pre-build packages ==

We're currently working on a new version of !NautilusSvn and intend to release easy to install packages (including a Debian package) in the very near future. You will be able to find the packages in the [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/downloads/list downloads section].

== Development snapshots ==

Currently we're regularly creating snapshots of our development version which we consider stable enough for actual usage, the instructions for installing these snapshots can be found [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/v012_Installation here].
