#summary Design considerations for the new UI implementation.
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =
The main concerns are:

  * Separation of actual version control logic and UI logic
    * Eventually we'll want to be able to support multiple version control systems, but at the moment we'll just focus on Subversion
  * Minimizing repetition (repeating statements, logic etc.)

= Directory structure =

Here's a possible directory structure to keep the files organized:

{{{
ui/interface.glade
ui/checkout.py # user interface logic
ui/add.py # same

lib/nautilussvn.py # versioning logic
}}}
