#summary How to install development snapshots
#labels Phase-Support

Whenever we want to share our work and consider trunk or the latest branch stable enough we make a snapshot. You can pull this snapshot from our repository and install the extension globally using the setup script (setup.py), here's how:

{{{
svn checkout http://nautilussvn.googlecode.com/svn/tags/latest-snapshot ~/Development/nautilussvn
cd ~/Development/nautilussvn
sudo python setup.py install
nautilus -q && nautilus &
}}}
