#summary How to install development snapshots
#labels Phase-Support

== Personal Copy ==

We tag development snapshots as we go, so people can try "testing" versions of NautilusSVN. If you don't want to install things system-wide (wise for a single user system), check out the [DevelopmentInstallation development installation] instructions, and remember to substitute *trunk* with *tags/latest-snapshot*.

*Please note* that even though these are testing snapshots, they're still not releases. In fact, they're emphatically NOT release ready. If you have problems, we'd really appreciate the feedback.

== System-Wide Install: No Packaging ==

You can pull the development snapshot from our repository and install the extension globally using the setup script (setup.py), here's how:

{{{
mkdir ~/Development
svn checkout http://nautilussvn.googlecode.com/svn/tags/latest-snapshot ~/Development/nautilussvn
cd ~/Development/nautilussvn
sudo python setup.py install
nautilus -q && nautilus &
}}}

After that you only have to svn update to get the latest snapshot.

== System-Wide Install: Packaged ==

If you do want to install a development snapshot system wide, but don't want to bypass your distribution's packaging system, you can build your own package, but it's a little bit more involved. Follow the instructions for [PackagingViaSVN packaging from SVN] â€” there is a *snapshot* section under there.
