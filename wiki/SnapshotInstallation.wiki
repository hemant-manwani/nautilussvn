#summary How to install development snapshots
#labels Phase-Support

*Please note:* these instructions are a bit old. Until we update them, I would recommend following the instructions [DevelopmentInstall here].

You can pull the development snapshot from our repository and install the extension globally using the setup script (setup.py), here's how:

{{{
mkdir ~/Development
svn checkout http://nautilussvn.googlecode.com/svn/tags/latest-snapshot ~/Development/nautilussvn
cd ~/Development/nautilussvn
# D
sudo python setup.py install
nautilus -q && nautilus &
}}}

After that you only have to svn update to get the latest snapshot.
