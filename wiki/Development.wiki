#summary This page contains some helpful pointers on developing NautilusSvn
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =
!NautilusSvn is pretty much like any other typical Python program, except it's a Nautilus extension. This has been known in the past to cause some problems, for example with threading.

= Finding your way around the wiki =
There are a couple of pages in the wiki relevant for developers:

  * [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/CodingStyle CodingStyle] serves as an introduction to the style we use for our code (also see [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP 8]).
  * [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/Future Future] is used for discussion and decisions related mostly to the architecture of NautilusSvn. Also see pages labeled [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/w/list?q=label:Phase-Design Phase-Design].
  * [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/Packaging Packaging] describes how NautilusSvn should be packages for a number of distros.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/Architecture Architecture] for a more detailed explination of !NautilusSvn's internals. Also see pages labeled [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/w/list?q=label:Phase-Implementation Phase-Implementation].

= Tips =
When modifying !NautilusSvn you'll have to restart Nautilus quite often, some !NautilusSvn developers are known to have the following alias in their ~/.bash_aliases file to make this a little easier:

{{{
nautilus-testing () {
        mkdir /tmp/nautilus-testing; 
        TMPDIR=/tmp/nautilus-testing nautilus --no-desktop "$1"
}
}}}

~~This allows you to run two Nautilus instances next to each other, one for development and the other for normal use. Note that the two instances share the same !NautilusSvn extension, but as long as you don't restart any changes aren't loaded.~~

It seems that starting with 2.24.1 you have to quit nautilus (nautilus -q) for this to work. 

You can start a Nautilus extension using this alias by:
{{{
$ nautilus-testing <directory to start in>
}}}
