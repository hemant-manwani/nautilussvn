#summary This page contains some helpful pointers on developing NautilusSvn
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =
!NautilusSvn is pretty much like any other typical Python program, except it's a Nautilus extension. This has been known in the past to cause some problems, for example with threading.

= Finding your way around the wiki =
There are a couple of pages in the wiki relevant for developers:

  * [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/CodingStyle CodingStyle] serves as an introduction to the style we use for our code (also see [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP 8]).
  * See [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/Unicode Unicode] for information on how to properly handle Unicode.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/Packaging Packaging] describes how NautilusSvn should be packages for a number of distros.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/Architecture Architecture] is used for discussion and decisions related mostly to the architecture of NautilusSvn. Also see pages labeled [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/w/list?q=label:Phase-Implementation Phase-Implementation] and [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/w/list?q=label:Phase-Design Phase-Design].

= Tips =

== Organizing your code ==

  _See DevelopmentInstallation_

== Starting Nautilus ==
When modifying !NautilusSvn you'll have to restart Nautilus quite often. So when you're working on !NautilusSvn quit Nautilus first (nautilus -q) and then start it up with:

You can start Nautilus using this alias by:
{{{
$ nautilus --no-desktop <directory to start in>
}}}

Whenever you want to reload any changes, simply close the window and start it back up again once you're done.

= Patches =

Patches can either be attached to a [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/issues/list relevant issue] or submitted to [http://groups.google.com/group/nautilussvn the mailing list].
