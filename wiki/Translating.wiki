#summary A guide for contributing translations to the NautilusSvn project
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Translating NautilusSvn is a fairly simple process.  We provide a template file that has the English text from our program and a space for the translated text that you will write.  The template file is located at nautilussvn/po/NautilusSvn.pot.

= Dependencies =

You will need the gettext and intltool utilities.

= Start a new translation =

Figure out your language and locale (i.e. en_US is English/United States, en_CA is English/Canada).  For a list of locale code, go [http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php here].  And for a list of country codes, go [http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists/english_country_names_and_code_elements.htm here].

Once you open your terminal emulator, type:
{{{
$ cd /path/to/nautilussvn
$ msginit --input=po/NautilusSvn.pot --locale=en_CA
$ mv en_CA.po po/en_CA.po
}}}

After updating the po/en_CA.po file with your translations, type:
{{{
$ mkdir -p locale/en_CA/LC_MESSAGES
$ msgfmt --output-file=locale/en_CA/LC_MESSAGES/NautilusSvn.mo po/en_CA.po
}}}

= Getting your translation to us =

[http://groups.google.com/group/nautilussvn Email] us your NautilusSvn.mo file and the .po file you created.  We will immediately update our development trunk, and it will be included in the next official release.
