= Tasks remaining for v0.12 Final =

  * Create packages for Ubuntu and Fedora
  * Document installation process for Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, maybe others.
  * Allow multiple selection for properties -- adamplumb
  * Figure out a new non file manager, non version control system specific name for NautilusSvn ([http://groups.google.com/group/nautilussvn/browse_thread/thread/4b5de75a62251a65 see this discussion])
  * Do a code review for the entire code base and refactor based on the results, with the goal of making the code more elegant, flexible, maintainable, robust etc.. Subtasks include: 
    * Eliminate all redundancy (e.g. context menu generation)
    * Logically organize helper functions (for example helper.path, helper.string etc.)
    * Make all functionality more robust (e.g. defensive coding, handling exceptions properly without "crashing" the extension)
    * Refactor DBus code since it is not up to DBus standards. -- brucevdkooij
  * Add the NautilusSvn icons to the UI window titlebars -- adamplumb
  * Allow resizing of table columns -- adamplumb

= Future =

  * Dialogs should always be centered relative to their parent (in our case Nautilus). These dialogs are transient (see set_transient_for, which we cannot use). -- adamplumb
  * Add missing merge options to the final page of the merge wizard (This needs to wait until we do further testing with the merge wizard) -- adamplumb
