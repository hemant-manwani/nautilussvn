= Idea =

Though we do a lot of informal testing and take great care to make sure the extension actually works we're currently not doing any formal testing. Formal testing (read: automated testing, unit testing etc.) is needed primarily for two reasons (there are more though):

  * As a developer you cannot do every single test from the top of your head. You will forgot to do some things which will lead to functionality X not working.

  * Regressions. Sometimes when you work on something, you break something completely else. Automated testing will help you to hunt these down immediately.

In the future we might look into using a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.

= Cases =

Some cases where tests would be very useful:

  * Verifying Unicode support

  * Verifying emblem handling (are emblems added properly with the correct status?)
