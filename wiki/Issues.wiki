= Viewing and searching issues =

  * [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/issues/list A list of all open issues (defects and feature requests).]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/issues/list?can=2&q=-priority%3ALow+-milestone%3AFuture A list of important open issues] (filtered out less important ones, should bring the list down quite a bit)
  * [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/issues/advsearch The advanced search page.]

= Submitting issues =

== Defects ==
First use the [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/issues/list?can=2&q=type:Defect search functionality] to find out if a defect (i.e. bug) has already been submitted. If you can't find anything file [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/issues/entry?template=Defect%20report%20from%20user a new issue]. Follow these steps:

  * Make sure you're running the latest release of `NautilusSvn`. 

  * Enable debug mode in NautilusSvn -> Settings

  * Start up a terminal inside a working copy and restart Nautilus using the following command:

{{{
nautilus -q; nautilus --no-desktop;
}}}

  * Try to reproduce the defect, if a traceback is shown make sure to include that in your issue report.

After you're done testing, close all Nautilus windows, hit ALT + F2 and type {{{nautilus}}} to start Nautilus as usual.

== Enhancements ==

Just as with defects, please use [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/issues/list?can=2&q=type%3AEnhancement the search functionality] to find out if somebody already thought up of this idea. If not, you can [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/issues/entry?template=Feature%20request%20from%20user file an enhancement here]. If at all possible include a UI mockup. An example of a mockup can be found in [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/issues/detail?id=38 this enhancement report].
