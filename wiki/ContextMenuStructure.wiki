= Notes =

  * The term "file" is used loosely to indicate both files and directories.
  * When a directory is selected sometimes a condition needs to be checked recursively.
  * Added files count as "under version control" (versioned) too.

= Menu structure =
Based on [http://code.google.com/p/nautilussvn/wiki/TortoiseSVN TortoiseSVN's menus].

`[1]` It's possible to do directory diffs, so maybe in a later version.

= Mockup =
The icons used in the mockup are from the default GNOME iconset or the Tango iconset. Rename was based on Gedit's logo. The lock was based on the screenlock icon from GNOME. The logo is a combination of Nautilus's logo (a nautilus shell) and Tango's file manager icon.
