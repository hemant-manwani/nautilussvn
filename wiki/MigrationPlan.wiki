Sunday September the 27th:

  * In the morning disable the old blog and post a notice that we're migrating the blog to a new server. -- adamplumb
  * Create a database dump and tar up the old WP install -- adamplumb
  * New install on Bruce's server, be sure to setup FTPS for clickable updates -- brucevdkooij
  * ...?
  * Profit?

Later:

  * Take notice of all current URLs (write them down)
  * Close old blog (RabbitVCS logo + notice that we're migrating)
  * Database backup
  * Import database in new install
  * Change permalink structure, i.e. /blog/ etc.
  * Create static 301 redirects on Adam's server for all old URLs
