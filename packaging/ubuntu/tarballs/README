NOTE ABOUT PACKAGING:

Because of the version string in the changelog it is necessary to have the "nautilussvn_0.12.orig" tarball in here, to be detected by svn-buildpackage. It should be replaced by whatever version is current, and packagers will have to manually rename the tarballs if they are building old releases.
