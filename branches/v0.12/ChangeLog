	* nautilussvn/lib/extensions/nautilus/NautilusSvn.py:
	NautilusSvn.py is in a state of flux right now (might be broken), but 
	committing anyways to save changes.
	
	* nautilussvn/lib/vcs/svn.py:
	Reverted SVN.status back to r387 but marked it deprecated and added 
	function status_with_cache to replace it (entirely refactored). I'm too 
	worried replacing status right now would break other stuff (and bother 
	Adam in the process).

	* nautilussvn/lib/extensions/nautilus/NautilusSvn.py:
	Updated workaround for the multiple emblem problem, now it seems to work.

	* nautilussvn/lib/extensions/nautilus/NautilusSvn.py:
	Ok, I've thought up of a possible workaround for the threading issues.

	* nautilussvn/lib/extensions/nautilus/NautilusSvn.py:
	Added temporary hack in get_background_items back in again to try and work
	around the multiple emblem problem (because it seems to work).

	* nautilussvn/lib/extensions/nautilus/NautilusSvn.py:
	* nautilussvn/lib/vcs/svn.py:
	Implemented cache to significantly improve performance. Also fixed bug
	which resulted in watches being added recursvily on the parent
	directory for every direct child item (see code review for more info),
	that was obviously a major performance drag.
	
	Not 100% sure if the status cache is implemently correctly, it's quite ugly.

	* nautilussvn/lib/extensions/nautilus/NautilusSvn.py:
	Described multiple emblem bug in detail, added sequence diagram to describe
	the interaction with StatusMonitor, modified debug statements and improved
	several comments.

	* nautilussvn/lib/extensions/nautilus/NautilusSvn.py:
	Added all the information I have in my head about the problems with 
	threading within a Nautilus Python extension including a debug callback
	demonstrating the problems.

	I think I understand the bug now invalidate_extension_info doesn't always
	lead to a update_file_info, but no idea why.

	* setup.py:
	Forgot to modify the icon theme name back to hicolor.
